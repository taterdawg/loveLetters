I was kinda joking when I said I\'d make this, but here we are. This is my "loveLetters" program. Click/Press the left and right sides to scroll through notes',"I'm going to write new notes every day, and put them here for you to read. You'll also be able to view any old notes whenever you want.","These first one's are a few slides long, sorry, but it's story time.","I remember when we first started dating, and we'd spend as nights watching tv until midnight. One of my fondest memories of that was actually before we started dating","We had been holding hands all through the movie, but at some point I decided to put my arm around you. Instead of pulling away like I expected, you leaned in","That night, you fell asleep on the couch with my arm around you. We hugged goodbye that night for like 15 minutes and you started to fall asleep again...","That night was so great, because it made me feel so insanely loved, more than I'd ever felt before.","I had hated myself for so long, I just didn't think anyone could love me, but you did.","You always contradicted yourself when the topic came up, you'd basically express you didn't have feelings for me because... [insert reason]","But, in the end, we got together, and I couldn't have been happier about that.","Through the good, the bad, the sad, and the terrible, I love you. We've changed so much since we met, and I'm pretty damned sure at this point we are to be together forever.","I love you more than everything in the universe, put together, on a giant kebab, with a honey glaze, roasted on aged wood in the universe dragon powered furnace.","In just a few short months we'll be able to live together. That thought, of being able to go to bed with you and wake up next to you every day makes me immeasurably happy.","Remember the old days when we'd email all the time? I do. I would fact-check those emails, too, so that I wouldn't embarrass myself. I love you Sydney, now more than ever.","Last night, you mentioned that there are a bunch of things you do now that we never would've done before, and I can't stop thinking about that. [this is multiple slides].","We've changed so much, Sydney, and mostly for the better. As time goes on we get closer, more comfortable, and I only love you more.","The adorable dances(and dancing together), the crazy sounds and quasants, the wonderful stories and wacky conversations, I love it all. I love you, Sydney.","Sydney, I love your face","I say that a lot, but dammit I mean it. You are the prettiest thing in world.","Before we started dating, at the wedding, I remember seeing you and just thinking, 'she's really pretty.'","And of course, you were all dressed up and stuff, but still. Then we danced at the wedding and when I took you home you finally took my coat.","Then, at prom you did that again and it made me so happy because you're just friggin adorable. I love you, Sydney.","I love you more than the clouds love the sky, the trees love the ground(or water), the teenagers love their cell phones, and the moth's love their lamps, combined.","Rewind to some Friday night. You came over and we wound up watching the Hobbit until like 10:30. The whole time, we were holding","After that happened, my mom was like 'that girl likes you.' I love you, Sydney","We\u2019re like 3 months away. Three months from tomorrow and you\u2019ll be 18 and then before long we can live together. I love you, wow.","I love you very much.","When we go to weed, it'll almost be like we're living together.
