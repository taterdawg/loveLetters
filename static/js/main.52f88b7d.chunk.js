I was kinda joking when I said I\'d make this, but here we are. This is my "loveLetters" program. Click/Press the left and right sides to scroll through notes',"I'm going to write new notes every day, and put them here for you to read. You'll also be able to view any old notes whenever you want.","These first one's are a few slides long, sorry, but it's story time.","I remember when we first started dating, and we'd spend as nights watching tv until midnight. One of my fondest memories of that was actually before we started dating","We had been holding hands all through the movie, but at some point I decided to put my arm around you. Instead of pulling away like I expected, you leaned in","That night, you fell asleep on the couch with my arm around you. We hugged goodbye that night for like 15 minutes and you started to fall asleep again...","That night was so great, because it made me feel so insanely loved, more than I'd ever felt before.","I had hated myself for so long, I just didn't think anyone could love me, but you did.","You always contradicted yourself when the topic came up, you'd basically express you didn't have feelings for me because... [insert reason]","But, in the end, we got together, and I couldn't have been happier about that.","Through the good, the bad, the sad, and the terrible, I love you. We've changed so much since we met, and I'm pretty damned sure at this point we are to be together forever.","I love you more than everything in the universe, put together, on a giant kebab, with a honey glaze, roasted on aged wood in the universe dragon powered furnace.","In just a few short months we'll be able to live together. That thought, of being able to go to bed with you and wake up next to you every day makes me immeasurably happy.","Remember the old days when we'd email all the time? I do. I would fact-check those emails, too, so that I wouldn't embarrass myself. I love you Sydney, now more than ever.","Last night, you mentioned that there are a bunch of things you do now that we never would've done before, and I can't stop thinking about that. [this is multiple slides].","We've changed so much, Sydney, and mostly for the better. As time goes on we get closer, more comfortable, and I only love you more.","The adorable dances(and dancing together), the crazy sounds and quasants, the wonderful stories and wacky conversations, I love it all. I love you, Sydney.","Sydney, I love your face","I say that a lot, but dammit I mean it. You are the prettiest thing in world.","Before we started dating, at the wedding, I remember seeing you and just thinking, 'she's really pretty.'","And of course, you were all dressed up and stuff, but still. Then we danced at the wedding and when I took you home you finally took my coat.","Then, at prom you did that again and it made me so happy because you're just friggin adorable. I love you, Sydney.","I love you more than the clouds love the sky, the trees love the ground(or water), the teenagers love their cell phones, and the moth's love their lamps, combined.","Rewind to some Friday night. You came over and we wound up watching the Hobbit until like 10:30. The whole time, we were holding","After that happened, my mom was like 'that girl likes you.' I love you, Sydney","We\u2019re like 3 months away. Three months from tomorrow and you\u2019ll be 18 and then before long we can live together. I love you, wow.","I love you very much.","When we go to weed, it'll almost be like we're living together. We'll be able to sleep together and wake up next to eachother everyday, and we'll go find bigfoot!","I messed up Sydney","I missed like 3 days of stuff","Now you've just gone through three slides, so I've made up for it right?","","","Hi.","That's it okay there's no more","","","Why are you still reading through these?","","","Birds aren't real","","","No","","Okay fine I'll do more, you're WELCOME","I love you, BT dubs","Sydney, you're my happy place, my Sydo, my Sydtastic Sydmantha who keeps on giving me S.S.S.S(Sudden anti-Sadness from Seeing Sydney)","Bananas are great and you'll never convince me otherwise.","Sydney I love you, and your little firey banana-pepper extremities.","Hi.","So umm... I always tell you how much I love your face.","And that's true. But, what I really love is how you do... well, most things, really.","I love how when we hug, you press your face against my chest and squeeze me tightly.","I love how you let me squish your face, how you send me adorable and silly pictures, I love how you let me tickle you and you laugh at my bits.","Sydney, I love how you love me.","I love you","Hi I love you, umm... can I tell you a secret? I love you","Your cheeks are like supernovas when they're flushed. All the freckles and stuff are stars and your face is the massive cloud of stellar gases.","Okay so, to start I want to acknowledge something. I love you. I've never really been able to say that about anyone except for you.","I've had crushes and even some pretty strong feelings towards people in the past, but I've never loved anyone like I love you.","One of the main differences between you and them is just... you love me. That goes a billion trillion asdfasf miles.","More than that, you're not stuck up in the world, when everyone else is. I can't think of a better way to say it, and why I love you, than that.","My favorite thing about you will always jsut be that you love me too, because well... it feels good to be loved.","But, that's kind of... in the background, if that makes sense? Like, it's there and I know it and you make me feel loved.","But its still not what I see constantly when I'm with you. What I see when I'm with you is well... you, but I see how you act.","You're not caught up in the future or the past worrying about what will happen or what has happened, you just... live in the moment.","When we first started dating, I admired that so much in you, because I could never be like that, and I know it causes you problesm but it's also amazing.","What I see when I'm around you is how you look at me and smile, how you bounce around and say 'quasant,' how you kiss me and live it when I kiss you all over.","I love that you love me, but what I see is all these other, wonderful things. I see how you laugh so hard you snort when I kiss all over your back and sides.","I see how you get this adorable smile when I kiss your cheek and press my face into you. And oh my god your smile... I love it so much.","I don't know why I haven't said much about your smile, but it's amazing. I mean, seeing anyone happy around me indirectly makes me happy too.","But your smile is the cutest thing ever and it's probably my favorite part of your face(except maybe your eyes, but idk tbh).","What I love about you is that you love me, that you're cheerful and kind, that you care so insanely much about people you cry because of a tragic event in the world.","I love that you can live in the moment, I love that you stop to look at the clouds and enjoy the world we have.","I love that you love me.","I love you.","We're going to go to California in only a little more than a day.","My family will be there, but for one week, we can live together in the midst of a large forest beside a lake.","We can explore, relax, and be together 24/7.","Hi Sydney, I love you! It sucks we don't get to do anything together today, but I'm pretty sure it will all be okay.","Tomorrow, we'll get up and drive to the airport, and before long we'll be hopping on a plane to Northern California.","When we get there, we can go explore the forest, cuddle, and go to sleep forever.","No matter what we end up doing in the future, I know this much: I fucking love you Sydney. Whether we're in a bus, a mobile home, or the back of a car, I love you.","Ohhhhh sayyy cannnn youuuuu seeeeee??????? I love you","So I need to say something. I have no idea why I love you. I've said before that it's 'because you love me,' and I think that's kinda true.","But it also isn't. Love alone wouldn't be enough because well... there are things I don't like, and that I like, too.","I wouldn't date someone who was a total asshole just because she loves me. But you have so much more.","There isn't a definitive thing that like... puts me over the line into loving you, if that makes sense?","But there are things you do and moments I look at you where I just 'fall in love all over again.'","For example, a few times you've just come over and you enter my room bouncing around with a smile. So that, I love that you do that","Sometimes(usually right when you walk in the room, or I walk in), I see your face, and there's like your neutral face, and then your 'special' face.","That sounds so weird... sorry. You have your normal face and then your face under certain circumstances. Like sometimes after work you come over super flushed.","Sometimes I see you with make up, sometimes we just did some kind of physical activity and you're flushed. Whatever it is, sometimes there's something different.","Sometimes it's just a different room with different lighting, and then I see your face and I literally can't look away. So your face, I love your face.","And there are moments... moments where I just go nuts because of how much I love you.","Moments like where we're laying down together and I have my head resting on your belly or your collarbone.","Moments like when we were in the car and I was laying on your lap or you were laying on me.","Moments like when we hug with minimal attire. So those moments, I love those moments, with you.","And sometimes you say things and do things that are so fucking silly. But... I love that. So that, I love your silliness.","Even the things that drive me nuts sometimes, I love those. I love you, Sydney.","I love you, Sydney. I will always love you. Thank you for dancing with me, even if it wasn't all perfect, it was fun, and we learned something.","Sydney, you're amazing. You're kind, energetic, enthusiastic, and passionate. You're the most adorable thing in the world and you're so fucking outrageously pretty.","No matter how many times the world hits you you just keep going, and that's fucking amazing. You never lose faith in people or the world, and above all, you don't quit.","I'm sure you do give up, I guess, but not where it counts. You never stopped trying to work on yourself, and you never gave in to the belief that the world was terrible.","I fugckling lorb you babe."],images:[{title:"",url:"",day:""}]}},20:function(e,t,o){},22:function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.r(t);var a=o(0),n=o.n(a),s=o(4),i=o.n(s),r=(o(18),o(5)),l=o(6),h=o(8),u=o(7),d=o(9),y=o(1),m=(o(20),o(2)),c=function(e){function t(e){var o;return Object(r.a)(this,t),(o=Object(h.a)(this,Object(u.a)(t).call(this,e))).iterateLeft=o.iterateLeft.bind(Object(y.a)(Object(y.a)(o))),o.iterateRight=o.iterateRight.bind(Object(y.a)(Object(y.a)(o))),o.onChange=o.onChange.bind(Object(y.a)(Object(y.a)(o))),o.state={currentText:m.text[m.text.length-4],day:m.text.length-3,input:""},o}return Object(d.a)(t,e),Object(l.a)(t,[{key:"iterateLeft",value:function(){this.setState({currentText:m.text[this.state.day-2],day:this.state.day-1})}},{key:"iterateRight",value:function(){this.setState({currentText:m.text[this.state.day],day:this.state.day+1})}},{key:"onChange",value:function(e){this.setState({currentText:this.state.currentText,day:this.state.day,input:e.target.value})}},{key:"render",value:function(){return"nathanlovesme"===this.state.input?n.a.createElement(n.a.Fragment,null,console.log(this.state),n.a.createElement("p",{id:"heart-text"},'"',this.state.currentText,'"'),n.a.createElement("div",{id:"loveButtons"},this.state.day-1>0?n.a.createElement("button",{id:"prevButton",onClick:this.iterateLeft},"Last"):n.a.createElement("div",{id:"prevButton"}),this.state.day<m.text.length?n.a.createElement("button",{id:"nextButton",onClick:this.iterateRight},"Next"):n.a.createElement("div",{id:"nextButton"}))):(console.log(this.state),n.a.createElement(n.a.Fragment,null,n.a.createElement("input",{onChange:this.onChange,type:"password",class:"passcode"})))}}]),t}(n.a.Component),w=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&o.e(1).then(o.bind(null,23)).then(function(t){var o=t.getCLS,a=t.getFID,n=t.getFCP,s=t.getLCP,i=t.getTTFB;o(e),a(e),n(e),s(e),i(e)})};i.a.render(n.a.createElement(n.a.StrictMode,null,n.a.createElement(c,null)),document.getElementById("root")),w()}},[[10,3,2]]]);
